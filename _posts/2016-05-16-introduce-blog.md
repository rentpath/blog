Goals of the Blog
-----------------

Given the extent RentPath has benefitted from open source software and the communities of many projects,
the central purpose of this blog is to “pay it forward:”
contribute technology, knowledge, and know-how

 

1.  Describe the use of open source at RentPath.

2.  Share software and methodologies created at RentPath.

3.  Promote the expertise of individual developers, designers, and system
    engineers.
